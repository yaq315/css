        <h1 class="art">The Art of Homemade Pizza</h1>
        <div class="Medi">
    <p >Nothing beats the comforting aroma of freshly 
    baked pizza. Crafting your own pizza at home lets
     you experiment with a variety of toppings and crust styles
    From a classic <span class="M">Margherita</span>  to a hearty meat lover's 
    delight, the possibilities are endless. Start with 
    a perfectly kneaded dough, spread a rich tomatc
    sauce, sprinkle mozzarella, and top with your favorite 
    ingredients. Baking pizza in a hot oven ensures
     a crispy crust and gooey cheese, creating a culinary
    masterpiece that's both fun to make and delicious to eat.</p></div>
    
    <h1 class="art">A Symphony of Flavors: Mediterranean Salads</h1>
    <div class="Medi">
    <p >Mediterranean salads are a celebration of fresh, 
    healthy, and vibrant ingredients. A classic option like the
     <span class="M">GREEK SALAD</span> combines crisp cucumbers, juioy
    tomatoes, and tangy feta cheese, drizzled with olive oil 
    and sprinkled with oregano. Add a handful of olives for an 
    authentic touch. Another favorite is the
    <span class="M">TABBOULEH</span>, a parsley-based salad with bulgur wheat, mint, and
     lemon juice. These salads are perfect as a light meal or
      a flavorful side dish, embodying
    the simplicity and richness of Mediterranean cuisine.</p></div>
